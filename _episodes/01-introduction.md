We’re going to start by creating a group definition of web scraping, and explore issues and concepts 
around web scraping.

Pair with a neighbor, and take a few minutes to talk about 
and write down words and phrases related to web scraping.  This can include 
what you think web scraping is, 
how it’s done, 
why anyone (including you) would want to web scrape, 
what issues might come up including roadblocks you (or others) might face.

Next, break into slightly larger groups (4-6 people), where you will compare your lists, and then 
explain or discuss terms and phrases from the list.  This will take about 10 minutes.  Identify the 
terms your groups resolves as well as those you are still struggling with.

Lastly, each group will report back on one issue resolved by their group and one issue not resolved 
by their group.  The instructor will collate these on a whiteboard and facilitate a discussion about 
what we will cover today and where you can go for help on those things we won’t cover.

title: Setup
---
If you want to participate in the hands-on section, please install 
[Anaconda][anaconda-setup] prior to the workshop.  

We will program with Python using the Jupyter notebook, a programming environment that runs in a 
web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. 
The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported 
(some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not). 

Please make sure you install **Python version 3.x**, and **test the Anaconda** installation before 
attending the workshop.
